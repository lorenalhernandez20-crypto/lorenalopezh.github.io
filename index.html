  <h1> WELCOME TO MY WEBSITE </h1>
  <h2> My hobbies </h2>
  <!-- For pharagraphs (tag <p>), the code does not support to identiphy the number or order of each pharagraph-->
  <p> I'm a person who finds joy in a variety of simple things, and many of them revolve around spending time with the people I love. </p>

  <br />

  <p> My absolute favourite thing to do is spend time <em> <b> with my children. </b> </em>
    <!--the format for "bold" text (tag <b>) shall be inside the emphasised text (tag <em>)--> We share a lot of similar interests, like:
  </p>
  <!--A paragraph tag (<p>) cannot contain a <ul> tag-->
  <!--unordered list starts-->
  <ul>
    <li> our love for animals, </li>
    <li> walks around the local lake o places with beautiful landscapes views, </li>
    <li> and watching TV as the Mexican show, <em>"El Chavo del 8". </em> </li>
  </ul>
  <!--unordered list finish-->

  </div>
  <!--All atributes with ""-->
  <!-- centered image ends -->

  <br />

  <p> Of course, we have our differences too! </p>
  <div> My daughter isn't a fan of rock music, and my son doesn't really like K-pop.
  </div>

  <br />

  <div> My daughter prefers to read mangas, while my son is into scientific and philosophical books yet I, on the other hand, enjoy titles like <em> The Perfume </em> (by Patrick Süskind) and <em> The Scorpions </em> (by Walter Dean Myers).
  </div>
  <!--A paragraph (<p>) cannot contain a <div> tag-->

  <br />

  <p> Here are some other activities that make me happy: </p>
  <!--list with different and manual (ASCII) bulleds starts-->
  <!--A list tag <li> always has to be inside a <ol> or an <ul>-->
  <ul>
    <li> Taking walks to reconnect with nature ☻ </li>
    <li> Listening to music. The genre I choose depends on my mood, or the activity I'm doing ☻ </li>
    <li> Taking photographs of things that I find beautiful or unique ☻ </li>
  </ul>
  <!--List with ASCII finish-->

  <br />
  <!--self closing br tag-->

  <p> I also love to get lost in a good movie or book. There’s nothing quite like a film that makes me laugh until my stomach hurts or one that's so gripping I can't look away. Similarly, I enjoy reading a book with a narrative that completely captures my attention. The stories can be so different, but the feeling of being totally absorbed is always a great one. </p>

  <br />

  <p> Here is a list of my go-to pastimes </p>

  <!--ordered list starts-->
  <!--Ordered list <ol> tag cannot be nested directly to a paragraph <p>-->

    <li> Spending quality time with my kids. </li>
    <li> Getting out into nature. </li>
    <li> Listening to music. </li>
    <li> Watching a great film. </li>
    <li> Reading an interesting book. </li>
    <li> Taking photos of beautiful or unique things. </li>
